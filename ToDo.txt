To Fix:
	Go through assignments and fix their wording 
		I think I want them to have a single assignment project with the menu items
	For summer semesters, move the project stuff up earlier
	Maybe move the database work up earlier (??)
	Chapter 3 has unneeded bootstrap setup
	Week 6, add the route parameter stuff from page 269 that matches the homework
	Week 9, add the other model binding examples.
	Final: -20pts if Azure doesn't work
	Final Rubrik: Remove April 27th line
	Demo 3 needs to be updated. Copy from 2023-SUM


========================
Change all the assignments to GitHub links
Add setup videos
	GitHub Instructions
	Course Overview
?? Can we add videos to a shell and use the same ones?
